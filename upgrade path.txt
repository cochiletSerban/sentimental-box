upgrade path
    add pingback to mqtt topic to know if device is up
    add timestamp to messages
    custom webInterface for AP connection with custom error handling
    add "printed" flag to eprom mem to print welcome/reconect to wifi 
    only once and keep AP up just 3min to prevent watchdog issue
    break reconection loop and feed watchdog  


it should attempt to reconect to wifi if it takes more than 10m
it should lunch wifiManager and wait a long time
